          <p id="highlight"><strong>Welcome!</strong> <br> This is a companion site to the book, <em>Mapping the Nation</em>, which explores a tremendously creative era in American cartography.</p>
          <p> From maps of disease and the weather to the earliest maps of the national population, this was a period when the very concept of a map was reinvented. By the early twentieth century, maps had become common tools of analysis, communication, and visual representation in an increasingly complex nation.</p>
          <p> Today we live in a world that is saturated with maps and graphic knowledge. The maps on this site reveal how this involved a fundamentally new way of thinking.</p>
